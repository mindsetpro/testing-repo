# Creating Themes
Discord BOT Dashboard allows for custom themes to be installed within your application, this documentation section will hopefully help you understand how you can create your own themes.

### üìÅ Resources
Before we begin you must have basic knowledge with CSS, this will undoubtedly help you with creating your own theme!

Next you will need to create a copy of the ``default.css`` file, this can be found in the themes folder of your application. If you cannot find it you can also get it [here!](https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2/blob/main/src/themes/default.css) Once you have made a copy and saved it somewhere you can start working on your theme.

### üé® Making your theme
First lets import your theme, make sure you have created a **unique** name for the file otherwise it might clash with other themes created by the community.

Head over to the settings page of your Dashboard and scroll down until you see the ``Dashboard Settings`` section, click on the button that says ``import`` and find you CSS file and select it.

Now that your theme has been imported please ensure you have selected it in the theme select dropdown menu.

Having knowledge with CSS this should be quite easy, make changes that you desire to the theme file you created.
