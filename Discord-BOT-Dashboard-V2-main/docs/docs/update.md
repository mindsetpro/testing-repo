# Updating
The update process is fairly simple.

#### ‚åö Installing Requirements
After downloading the latest version [here](https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2/releases), you will need to install the requirements again. You can do this using the following command.
```bash
npm install
```
#### üñ•Ô∏è Setup
Locate the old version of Discord BOT Dashboard you have installed and locate the ```config``` folder in the root directory. Copy all files from this folder into the new versions ```config``` folder that you have downloaded. If you also downloaded external plugins please copy over the ``commands`` folder!

#### ‚úÖ Done
Everything should be ready now, all the plugins that you had setup previously should copy over to the new version including the BOT Settings.
